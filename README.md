The [France 2030 Robotics Committee](https://c-robotique-france2030.org/) acts as the interface between the France 2030 initiative, the academic world, robotics technology providers, and system integrators. Its mission is to coordinate communities such as the Robotics Transfer Challenge and the winners of France 2030 “Robotics” project calls, as well as all stakeholders in robotics technologies and services. It provides services designed to accelerate the transformation of research outputs into business value within the robotics sector.

The Committee’s objectives are to:

Strengthen exchanges and technology transfers between public research, technology providers, and system integrators.

Promote research-industry collaborations to drive innovation in robotics.

Enhance the skills of robotics integrators and, more broadly, companies—including startups.

Knowledge and technology transfer serve as key levers for addressing major societal challenges while fostering value creation and economic growth for businesses.
